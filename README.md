Comparing the Northern and Southern Hemisphere temperatures we can see that the temperatures are higher the closer to the equator that we are and the line of regression
is creating a mirrored image for the 2 hemispheres.
The line of regression for humidity appear similar for both the northern and southern hemispheres, both are slightly posittive in nature.
Wind Speeds in the northern hemisphere appear to be more consistent than those in the southern hemisphere.
Variability in Cloudiness doesnt not appeat to be impacted in relation to the distance from the equator.
